## Vulnerability Outline
**To exploit the vulnerabilities outlined below, utilize the secret-keeper-not-secure branch**

### Brute-Force Attack
**brutePass.sh**
* BrutePass takes advantage of the PUT login to test username and password combos
* Usernames are provided by the script user
* Passwords are taken from passwords.txt which has the 10000 top passwords

**Directions to use brutePass.sh:**
1. Place brutePass.sh and passwords.txt in the same directory
2. Open a connection to osu servers (do not use flip3, or the same server as the site is hosted if not flip3)
3. Open the directory with brutePass.sh
4. You may need to give yourself permission to run the script: chmod 777 brutePass.sh

**To use the script:** ./brutePass.sh -g username URL

**Examples:**
* ./brutePass.sh -g Kyle flip3.engr.oregonstate.edu:6061
* ./brutePass.sh -g Katie flip3.engr.oregonstate.edu:6061
* ./brutePass.sh -g Admin flip3.engr.oregonstate.edu:6061

**bruteForce.sh**
* BruteForce takes advantage of the PUT login to test username and password combos
* Usernames are provided by the script user
* Passwords are generated by systematically creating strings of characters
* Note: the script only generates passwords of up to 4 characters, more could be implemented

**Directions to use bruteForce.sh:**
1. Open a connection to osu servers (do not use flip3, or the same server as the site is hosted if not flip3)
2. Open the directory with bruteForce.sh
3. You may need to give yourself permission to run the script: chmod 777 bruteForce.sh

**To use the script:** ./bruteForce.sh -g username URL

**Examples:**
* ./bruteForce.sh -g John flip3.engr.oregonstate.edu:6061


### SQL Injection Attack
**HTML SQL Injection:**
* SQL code can be inserted into the URL as placeholders are not used for MySQL credential checks
* Use the following URL to access users' information without their credentials
```
http://flip3.engr.oregonstate.edu:6061/user/*%20OR%20ALL&*%20OR%20ALL
```

### HTML Injection Attack
**To inject a script:**
1. Navigate to the frequently-asked-questions page
2. Add a new question, using the following as the value: 
```
>"&amp;gt;<script>alert("Warning: This site is vulnerable to an attack")</script>
```
3. Click on the question in the lefthand nav menu. Note the pop-up alert warning of a possible attack.
4. Similarly, a link may be injected using the following format:
```
<a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss//" target="_blank">Learn more about XSS</a>
```
5. To view the vulnerability, click the question in the lefthand nav menu then click the link. Note redirection to the website included in the href field.


### Buffer Overflow Attack
**bufferExploit.sh**
* BufferExploit takes advantage of the buffer used on record names when inserting a new record
* A curl POST is sent with a number value, allocating empty space instead of saving a string value
* Overflow memory is then accessed on the user page as a new record with the name being the data

**Directions to use bufferExploit.sh:**
1. The data for the Kyle profile has been hardcoded into the attack code (the attacker needs a profile and their profile ID)
2. Run the script and access memory data at flip3.engr.oregonstate.edu:6061/user/Kyle&12345
3. Repeatly run the script to get chunks of memory to later decode and decipther

**To use the script:** ./bufferExploit.sh


### Denial of Service (DoS) Attack
**Proof of Concept: Fork Bomb**
1. Make sure that the active internet browser will not block popups
2. Add a new record, using the following as the value for the record name:
*  Change URL to link to user profile in use
```
>"&amp;gt;<script>
function fork() {
  	const win = window.open("http://flip3.engr.oregonstate.edu:6061/user/Kyle&12345");
	setTimeout(fork(), 1);
}
fork(); </script>
```
3. Select the name of the record from the record table to intitate fork bomb
* **WARNING: This will slow down the user computer**
* This does not bring down the school server (thankfully) rather it illustrates how to slow down a weak server
* The Kyle account has this record already saved and ready to initiate 

**Proof of Concept: dosExploit.sh**
* dosExploit.sh opens multiple concurrent POST requests to the server to save new records
* The limit rate for sending the record is set to a very slow rate which ties up server resources
* A weak server will be slowed down while waiting for the requests to finish
* The data for the Kyle profile has been hardcoded into the attack code (the attacker needs a profile and their profile ID)
* **WARNING: This will slow down the user computer, if not crash it outright**
* This does not bring down the school server (thankfully) rather it illustrates how to slow down a weak server

**To use the script:** ./dosExploit.sh
